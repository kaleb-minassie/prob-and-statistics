## Computer Engineering - Probability, Statistics, and Random Processes

## Brief Overview
This course covers how to model and analyze uncertainty in engineering systems. We study probability theory, work with random variables and common distributions, apply statistical methods to data, and explore random processes such as noise signals. The course is fully project-based and uses MATLAB to simulate and analyze real-world scenarios in signal processing, communications, and machine learning.
