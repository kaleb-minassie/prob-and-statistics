# üìä CMPE320 Project 1 - Histograms, PMFs, and PDFs

## üìå About

Hey! In this project, we explore how random events like rolling dice, flipping coins, or generating random numbers can help us understand probability. We use MATLAB to run experiments and collect data, then turn that data into histograms, which are simple bar graphs that show how often each result happens. From there, we see how those histograms start to look like real probability models called PMFs for discrete data and PDFs for continuous data. The idea is to watch how randomness forms clear patterns when we run enough trials and organize the results the right way.

## üéØ Goal

The main goal is to prove that if we repeat random experiments enough times, the results start to match the real probability functions we learn about in class. We also want to:
- Practice turning data into histograms  
- Convert those into PMFs or PDFs  
- Compare what we get with the "true" values like expected averages and spreads  
- Learn how to calculate probabilities using both raw data and math  

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Here‚Äôs how the project goes:  
1. We simulate random events in MATLAB, like rolling an eight-sided die, flipping binary coins, or generating values from known mathematical distributions like the normal or Laplace distribution.  
2. We create histograms to show how often each result appears in our simulations.  
3. We scale the histograms so they represent probabilities and match the shape of the distribution we expect.  
4. We compare the experimental results to what probability theory says, using the sample mean and variance.  
5. We plot everything and analyze how closely our histograms resemble shapes like a perfect bell curve for a normal distribution or a sharp peak for a geometric distribution that models the number of trials until the first success.
